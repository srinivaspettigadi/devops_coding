1. Run the container as a non-root user

root is the default user inside a Docker container.
If you do not specify a user while starting a container, it will run by default as the user set in the image (last USER command in the Dockerfile) 
or the one inherited from the parent image file (specified by the FROM command in the Dockerfile).

It is recommended to create a non-root user to run the first process of the container. In addition to this, any non-required users must be deleted.

2. Remove unnecessary packages/software from the image

Having unnecessary packages in the Docker images not just bloats the size of the image, but it also increases the attack surface of the container.
All the Docker images must be carefully examined for installed packages, and only the packages required for the functioning of the service(s) 
in the container must be included.

3. Scan and rebuild images to include security patches

Whether you are building your Docker image from scratch or you are building them on top of the third-party image,
it is very important to have your images scanned for vulnerabilities as part of your continuous integration process.
This includes scanning included packages, binaries, libraries, files, etc. against one or more well-known vulnerabilities databases.
